    <h3 class="headline">SAT scores by school district, 2016-17</h3>
    <div class="explainer">
      Connecticut began having all students take the SAT test, referred to
      as "universal" SAT testing, in 2015-16. The second year of data, for
      2016-17, is out now. Below you can search for your district and see
      how many students are considered college- and career-ready and severely behind,
      as well as which direction scores moved from one year to the
      next. The bars next to each district's name represent math and ELA
      scores on an 800-point scale.
